# Hello-World
My first repository!!

My first edits.  
I am new to Python and nervous about how my old ass is going to learn python.  
My last trip to MS office in Manhattan I spent the whole 2.5 hours hardly doing much.
Now, I am able to use anaconda plus importing of pandas and numpy.  

More exciting is now, I signed up for my very FIRST GitHub account!!
And making changes to my first projects.
Awesome!!
